# Snakes and Ladders

## Overview
This project is a digital version of the classic **Snakes and Ladders** board game built using **Python’s Tkinter library**.  
Players roll a virtual dice to move across the board, climb ladders, and avoid snakes.  
The game supports up to **four players** and features a visually interactive board rendered using Tkinter’s Canvas.

---

## Features
- Interactive graphical board (10x10 grid).
- Up to **4 players** with customizable names.
- Real-time player movement and dice rolling.
- Automatic handling of **snakes** and **ladders** interactions.
- Dynamic game messages and player turns.
- Input validation for player name entries.

---

## How to Play
1. Run the script in your Python environment.  
2. Enter 1–4 player names and click **Start Game**.  
3. Each player takes turns clicking **Roll Dice**.  
4. The player’s token moves according to the dice roll:
   - Landing on a **ladder** moves the player up.
   - Landing on a **snake** moves the player down.
5. The first player to reach **position 100** wins the game.

## Example Gameplay
Player 1 rolled a 4.
Climbed a ladder! Moving up from 7 to 14.
Player 2's turn. Click Roll Dice.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- GUI programming with **Tkinter**
- Canvas-based drawing and coordinate mapping
- Randomization with the `random` module
- Event-driven programming (buttons and callbacks)
- State management for multiple players
- Control flow using loops and conditionals

---

## Requirements
- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- Built-in libraries only:
  - `tkinter`
  - `random`

---

## Future Improvements
- Add a visual dice animation.
- Include background music or sound effects.
- Display snakes and ladders graphically.
- Save and load player progress.
- Refactor to object-oriented design for better scalability.
