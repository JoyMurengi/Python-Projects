# Rock-Paper-Scissors


## Overview
This is a simple **Python command-line game** where the player competes against the computer in a best-of-three match of Rock, Paper, Scissors.  
The game demonstrates the use of conditional logic, loops, user input handling, and randomization.

---

## Features
- Best of 3 rounds gameplay.
- Real-time score tracking.
- Random computer choices.
- Input validation for player moves.
- Displays final winner after all rounds.

---

## How to Play
1. Run the script in your terminal or IDE.
2. Type one of the following choices when prompted:  
   - `rock`

## Example Output
Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!

Type Rock, Paper, Scissors: rock
You chose: rock
Computer chose: scissors
You win this round!
Score: You = 1 Computer = 0

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`while`)
- Randomization using `random.choice()`
- User input handling with `input()`
- Score tracking and control flow

---

## Requirements
- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- No external libraries required (uses only built-in Python modules)

---

## Future Improvements
- Add input retry for invalid entries instead of skipping a round.
- Implement a replay option after the game ends.
- Add color-coded terminal output.
- Expand to “best of 5” or customizable rounds.
